I am a second-year PhD student in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, advised by [Cheng Tan](https://naizhengtan.github.io/). My research focuses on the intersection of large language models (LLMs), computer systems, and security. I also work on neural network for computer systems.

My current projects include:
- **BOA**: A system to formalize and solve the jailbreak oracle problem for LLMs using search over different decoding paths.
- [**NN4SysBench**](https://shuyilinn.github.io/BenchmarkWeb/): A benchmark for studying neural network verification in computer systems, accepted to NeurIPS 2024 (Datasets & Benchmarks Track).

Outside of research, I enjoy driving and visiting U.S. National Parks. 
When I get stuck on research, I also enjoy cleaning my room :)
