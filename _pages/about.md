I am a second-year PhD student in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, advised by [Cheng Tan](https://naizhengtan.github.io/). I am working on Large Language Model Systems and safety. I am creating systems to evaluate LLMs efficiently and comprehensively.

### Interests
Outside of research, I find peace in Chinese calligraphy, painting, and medieval landscape art. I also enjoy reading quiet literature.

I am also a road trip enthusiast. My dream is to drive across the US with a detailed plan: starting from Boston to New York, through the Midwest (Ohio, **the Great Lakes** in Michigan, Iowa, Nebraska), visiting the **Rocky Mountains** in Colorado, the **Grand Canyon** in Arizona, and the **deserts** in Utah and Nevada. Finally, I plan to drive up the scenic **Pacific Coast** from Los Angeles to Vancouver.

Feel free to contact me if you share this dream—maybe we can do it together! ...But first, I need to find an internship.
